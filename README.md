# ML and AI Essentials

Welcome to ML and AI Essentials, a repository designed to provide hands-on coding examples for various machine learning and AI topics. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that accompany the theoretical explanations found on the [Average AI Student blog](https://averageaistudent.com/).

## About
This repository is a growing collection of essential machine learning and AI concepts. Each notebook provides practical coding examples and demonstrations. For a deeper dive into the theory behind these topics, visit the associated blog posts on [Average AI Student](https://averageaistudent.com/).

## First Topic: Embeddings, Latent Space, and Representations
The first topic in this series is Embeddings, Latent Space, and Representations. In this section, you'll find a Jupyter notebook that explores how embeddings work, how they capture the essence of data, and how they are represented in a latent space.

Check out the blog post that explains these concepts in detail: [Embeddings, Latent Space, and Representations](https://averageaistudent.com/embeddings-latent-space/).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the topic folder of interest.
3. Explore and run the examples to gain a practical understanding of the concept.
4. Read the associated blog post for a thorough theoretical explanation.
